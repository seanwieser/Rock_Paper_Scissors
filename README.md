# Rock_Paper_Scissors

## Introduction

Rock Paper Scissors is a game played by two people where each player simulataneously configures their hand into the shape of a rock, paper, or scissors. Depending on what each player chose to do, a winner is determined by the following: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. An example of a hand in each of these configurations is shown below.

## Data
### Inital Training Set
I found the dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors/version/2?) containing pictures of different hands in each of the three configurations: rock, paper, and scissors. After some restructering and renaming of files, the directory tree is as follows:

+-- data <br />
