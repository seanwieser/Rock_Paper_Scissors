# Rock_Paper_Scissors

## Data
I found a dataset on Kaggle containing pictures of different hands in each of the three configurations: rock, paper, and scissors. The directory tree is as follows 

.
+-- data <br />

|   |   +-- rock
|   |   +-- scissors

Image Classification with Rock Paper Scissors image dataset. Build/Use a CNN to be able to classify whether an image is of a hand in the Rock, Paper, or Scissors configuration. 

Dataset is here: https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/rock-paper-scissors-dataset?
Another dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors/version/2?

If I am able to do this early enough in the week, I can set up my raspberry pi with a camera in order to set up a way for me to play rock, paper, scissors against my computer (with some dumb AI).
